Subject: A Revised Update on the Number of Opportunity Youth in South King County


Opportunity Youth are defined as people aged 16 - 24 who are neither enrolled in school or working. They represent a vulnerable group of youth that face many challenges throughout their early life (and beyond). The Seattle Region Partnership (a multi-sector initiative founded by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Seattle Foundation, City of Seattle, and King County) has directed efforts to aid this group of youth, and our project looks to update current research with more up-to-date data. Opportunity Youth represent a group that could be helped with community programs and outreach. The l Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from 2014. The Road Map Project is a mast research publicly released on the topic is based upon a report from 2016 (made by the Road Map Project) that utilizes USulti-sector organization dedicated to addressing systemic barriers to racial equity, to help students succeed. In our research we used PUMS data from 2017.


Our research estimates show that there are just over 12,000 Opportunity Youth in the Road Map Project region (South Seattle and South King County). This is a marked decrease to the 19,000 reported in the 2016 study (and recently reported in the Seattle Times). A possible trend we have identified is that the percentage of Opportunity Youth with a college degree (Associates degree or higher) has decreased by 6% (total between all age groups) when compared to 2014 figures. We have also found that in the 19-21 Age Group, college enrollment has decreased by 3% relative to 2014. Lastly, another trend we have identified is that the percentage of Opportunity Youth that have completed High School (or obtained a GED) has increased by 6% (when compared to 2014 figures). 


A caveat to our report is that the Road Map Project has not made clear their methodology and data sources. The geographic coverage of our studies most likely differ and this could be a reason why our totals differ from the previous study. As previously stated, our studies relies on US Census PUMS data. One obvious shortfall is that the PUMS region that includes Federal Way (which is part of the Road Map Project region) also includes Vashon Island (which is not part of the Road Map Project region). 


These trends may indicate that current projects aimed at younger Opportunity Youth have helped positively in aiding more to graduate high school. However since we are seeing less Opportunity Youth enter college or graduate college, this might be an opportunity for more targeted aid aimed at Opportunity Youth who have graduated high school, but have not entered the workforce or entered/finished college.
